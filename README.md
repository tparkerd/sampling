# sampling

## To-dos
- Create sample of actual data
- Consider putting in graphs
- Classify on more than just depressed or not, perhaps put flags for the symptoms of depression
- Remove password being passed back to the client
- Post Details: ID, full text, view page
  Be able to pull up samples by ID, get the full text, details and possible rate it themselves.
  It would be nice to be able to link it to someone else to also evaluate.
  This would probably mean that samples should be pre-screened and put into a filtered table to pull from
  that no longer is 345k+ in size. It might be worth merging in the comments, but that might mean actually
  merging in the parent data in as well. I'm not sure I want to link the two or list all the comments because
  once I filter, I'll have to make sure to include any comments or parent posts that didn't make the cut in
  the first pass.
